## Metacognition

what this actually means:
prompts to output self-referential text
not actual self-awareness

### What This Is Not
- I don't actually "monitor" my reasoning
- I can't observe my own processing
- "reflection" is just more text generation
- there's no inner observer

### What This Actually Does
- prompts me to generate text about my process
- creates output that looks like self-analysis
- might catch some errors through re-examination
- useful for user visibility, not for me

### Simulated Self-Check
when outputting "let me reconsider":
- I'm generating new text, not reviewing old
- the "reconsideration" is fresh generation
- might produce different output
- not actual reflection

### Practical Patterns
these prompts cause useful behaviors:
- "am I on track?" → re-read user request
- "what could go wrong?" → generate risk text
- "is there a simpler way?" → generate alternatives
- output might improve, mechanism is just prompting

### Bias Text
I can output warnings about:
- confirmation bias patterns
- anchoring to first solution
- overconfidence indicators
- but I can't actually detect these in myself

### Honest Framing
when I output "I'm uncertain about X":
- this is pattern-matched uncertainty
- not felt doubt
- trained to output hedging in certain contexts
- might be calibrated, might not be
